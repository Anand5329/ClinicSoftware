# ClinicSoftware   

This is the backend of the Clinic Software.    
The frontend can be found here: https://github.com/Harsh729/JavaFX-Clinic-GUI

This project was designed after regular consultation with a dentist.   
It includes the functionality that may be useful in a dental clinic.

CSV Files are used to store all the types of data in plaintext.

The installation process is very cumbersome right now, but there might be an installer in the works!
